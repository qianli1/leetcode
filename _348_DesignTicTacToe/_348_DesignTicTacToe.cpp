    /**
    * 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe
    * Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

    You may assume the following rules:

    A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
    Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
    A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
    Example:
    Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

    TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

    toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
    |X| | |
    | | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
    | | | |

    toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
    |X| |O|
    | | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
    | | | |

    toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
    |X| |O|
    | | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
    | | |X|

    toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
    |X| |O|
    | |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
    | | |X|

    toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
    |X| |O|
    | |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
    |X| |X|

    toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
    |X| |O|
    |O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
    |X| |X|

    toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
    |X| |O|
    |O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
    |X|X|X|
    Follow up:
    Could you do better than O(n2) per move() operation?
